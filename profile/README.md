## Hi there 👋
🙋‍♀️ Clax Software is a group of people run by [OrangeMax](https://github.com/orangemaxx) and [AquillaPebble](https://github.com/quiluh). <br>
🌈 Contribution guidelines - We don't usually take contributions however we will let you know. <br>
👩‍💻 Useful resources - We are in the process of getting a website setup and working. We'll let you know when we do! <br>
🍿 Fun facts - We almost allways use the open source Godot 4 engine. We use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for notes and [blender](https://blender.org) for 3d and animation. <br>
